Note: Basic Introduction of Data Types

-c s/w compiler + library
-header file
-.h for header file
-a=20 identifier
-if we will give input A then key board will type A but cpu will understand 65 in binary so for that we have to use (int a and string a)
-Data types
primitive     derived     user-defined
int            array          structure
float          pointer         union
char           string            enum
bool                            typedef
void
-int (short(signed(default),unsigned(-ve not allowed)),int,long,long long)
-floating (float,double,long double)
-char(signed,unsigned)
