short int a = 20;
printf("%d",a);
here %d is format specifier

%d - short int,int;
%ld = long int;
%lld = long long int;
%u = unsigned short int,int

if value is unsigned but negative number so sub(-) from max;
ex: unsigned short int = -2; output:65534(65535-2); 
recall round circle diagram**

scanf("%d",&a);

char signed = 256
unsigned 0 to 255;
-128 to 127

important**
